# Plant Monitoring System #
It's a project I made that is helpful in monitoring plants 24/7 
It provides all the necessary things to the plant based on surrounding conditions

# Features of this project #
1) Measure the soil moisture
2) Keep track of temperature
3) Track Raining
4) Automated water supply system
5) Automated shade to protect from harsh sun during mid-day.

# Components used #
1) 1602 (16x2) LCD Display With I2C/IIC Interface - Blue Backlight (or any display)
2) Soil Moisture Sensor Module
3) 1 Channel 5V Relay Module
4) Tower Pro MG90S Metal Gear Servo Motor (180 Degree Rotation)
5) WeMos ESP8266 D1 R2 V2.1.0 WiFi Development Board or (Any microcontroller)
6) Male/Male, Male/Female, Female/Female Cable
7) XL6009 DC-DC Adjustable Step UP Boost Power Converter Module
8) Submersible Mini Water Pump - 3-6V DC
9) DHT11 - Temperature And Humidity Sensor Module
10) GL12 840 Points Solderless Breadboard
11) Electrical PVC Insulating Tape
